Dear Sirs: Dear John: Dear Alfred: Dear Dr. Stone: To Heathkit:
Sarah had liked knitting all her life.

She looked past her garden to the fields and longed to see the other side.

All the sane people in this area sold their goldright at the start.

The insane ones held theirgold and later it paid off.
One fine afternoon the king had an idea.

Hesent a letter to all the lords and ladies ofhis land.
He asked for a great feast.
His people preared roasts.
His jester did a jig.
All the people left hoping to do it again.
