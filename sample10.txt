			      LESSON T10\B
Let's review the entire alphabet before starting the number keys.\I

			NUMERIC KEYS

The terminal has two sets of numeric keys. One set--directly above the
alphabetic keys--conforms to the standard for typewriter keyboards.
The other set--to your right--resembles a calculator keypad. In this
typing series we will be concerned only with the standard numeric keys
on the main keyboard. (If you would like to learn to touch type on a
numeric keypad, use the N-series lessons instead.)

NOTE - not all terminals have the numeric keys in a separate keypad\T

The numeric keys, like all the keys you will be learning from now on,
vary somewhat from machine to machine. The 2 through 0 keys are always
in exactly the same place on all typewriter keyboards. (On keypunch
machines and some terminals, however, they are located over the U, I, O,
J, K, L, M, comma and period keys. We will not be concerned with these
layouts in this series.)
Even if a typewriter or terminal has the standard 2 through 0 keys, it
may not have a 1 key. If it does, the 1 will always be next to the 2.
If it does not, you will have to use the L-key.\T
Let's start by using the 1-key, since we have one. (Use your A-finger.)\I
aaa a1a aaa 111 aaa a1a\D
a1q qa1 qz1 az1 aq1 a1z
111 and 111 ate 111 any 111
If 11 men each catch 11 fish in 11 days, how many fish were caught?\D
Use your S-finger for the 2-key.\I
sss s2s sss s2s sss s2s\D
sss s2w sss 2xw sss w2x sss
222 saw 222 was 222 wet 222
The 2 men were 2 late 2 catch the 2 PM train.\D
Use your D-finger for the 3-key.\I
ddd d3d ddd d3d ddd d3d ddd\D
ddd d3e ddd d3c ddd e3c ddd
333 did 333 cat 333 eat 333
1 plus 2 is 3. 11 plus 22 is 33. 111 plus 222 is 333.\D
The last number we will practice today is the 4-key. (Use your F-finger.)\I
fff f4f fff f4f fff f4f\D
fff f4r fff 4vr fff 4vr fff
444 for fff rat 444 vet 444
Flight 423 leaves from gate 42 at 4:24.
As the 3 musketeers say: 1 4 all, and all 4 1.
If 1/4 plus 2/3 is 11/12, what is 1/2 plus 1/3?\D
Try your speed on this line:\I
Our team won 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place at the 12th annual outing.\P
1 and l

As we stated earlier, many typewriters do not have a 1 key. Let's
practice using the L-key as a 1, so you can use any kind of typewriter.\T
One dozen is l2. A gross is l2 dozen or l44.\D
In both octal and decimal, ll times ll is l2l. And, 3 minus 4 is -l.
But in octal, l2 is not divisible by 3.\D
